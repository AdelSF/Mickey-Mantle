Perhaps Mickey's most famous home run, it coined the term \"tape-measure home run.\" Mickey laid into a medium high fastball thrown right down the middle and got it all. The ball rocketed out of the park high above the 391-foot sign in left-centerfield. It was still rising when it hit the 60-foot high National Beer sign atop the football scoreboard that sat above the last row of the bleachers. Undeterred, it carried out of Griffith Stadium, crossed 5th St. and finally landed in the backyard of 434 Oakdale St., several houses away. Yankees' PR Director Arthur \"Red\" Patterson raced from the press box to the place outside the park where the ball had been recovered by 10-year old Donald Dunleavy. Dunleavy showed him where the ball landed. Red measured the distance: 565 feet - the longest home run ever measured! The ball itself was lopsided from the blow - Mickey had literally \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" Contrary to popular myth, Patterson calculated the distance by using the Griffith Stadium dimensions and then pacing off the remaining distance. Nevertheless, the term \"tape-measure\" stuck and remains popular today.",

        "description": "Mickey walloped another tape-measure home run in a10-inning game that featured a wild and vicious brawl between the Yankees and the Browns. Mickey's homer in the third inning carried out of the park in left-field, bounced off a second-floor porch 15-20 feet high on a house across the street from the park, and landed in the yard of another house on Sullivan Ave. Red Patterson measured this ball too. It was reported as 494 feet, but that was the distance to the base of the house it hit. Given it's height - over 15 feet when it hit the porch - it would have gone well over 500 feet. Mickey's homer gave the Yankees and 6-0 lead, but they couldn't hold it and the Browns tied it 6-6. In the top of the 10th Gil McDougal, scoring from second on an infield out, collided with catcher Clint Scrap Iron Courtney, knocking the ball loose to score the game-winning run. In the bottom of the tenth Courtney hit a long single and deliberately tried to stretch it to a double so he could spike shortstop Phil Rizzuto. Yankees' players came to Rizzuto's defense, the benches emptied and a wild fight ensued. When order was restored Browns' fans threw bottles at left-fielder Gene Woodling, almost causing a forfeit. After the game the Yankees were escorted out, armed with bats for protection.",

        "description": "Mickey got off to a slow start in 1954 mainly due to off-season knee surgery and rehab. The first surgery in November 1953 was to remove torn cartilage from his right knee - the same knee he'd injured in the 1951 World Series. Mickey wasn't fully dedicated to his rehabilitation - he later said he had been \"lazy and sloppy\" about his program - and re-injured himself in a basketball game. He had a second surgery just before spring training to remove a fluid-filled cyst from behind his knee, which prevented him from participating in most of spring training. His bad knee particularly hampered his left-handed batting - he couldn't step into pitches properly because his right knee would buckle - and in some instances rode the bench against right-handed pitchers. Mickey's first homer of the 1954 season come in the second game of a \"Patriot's Day\" morning/afternoon doubleheader in Boston where the Red Sox won the first game 2-1. In that game Mickey struck out four times, the last time on three pitches with the bases loaded in the ninth inning. In the second game Mickey hit a solo shot for his first homer of the 1954 season.",

It was early enough in the season for him to raise his average 37 points in this one game, taking his average above .250. He also drove in ten runs in this three-game series with Boston, more than doubling his season total from 7 to 17.

        "description": "Mickey's second home run of the game, a tremendous 500-foot shot into the upper deck in right field, was Mickey's response to a taunt from Joe Collins. Mickey was getting a lot of press about his long home runs ever since his monster shot at Griffith Stadium in Washington in April 1953. Collins was batting second in front of Mickey. When Collins batted in the eighth inning he drove a Ray Narelski 475-feet into the upper deck in right field. As he crossed the plate he said to Mickey, \"Go chase that!\"On the first pitch from Narelski Mickey walloped the ball deep to right-field in the same direction as Collins' homer. But Mickey's shot went about twenty-five feet further toward center and several rows deeper into the same upper deck seats as Joe's homer went. Mickey's homer went nearly five-hundred feet! When Mickey got back to the dugout he headed to the water fountain by Collins. As he took a sip he asked, \"What did you say, Joe?\" Collins replied, \"Aw, go sh#* in your hat!\"",

Leading off the sixth inning Mickey absolutely crushed Bob Lemon's first pitch deep into the upper deck in right-field, about 100 feet above the 344-foot sign at field level. The Yankees victory keeps them in the hunt for the pennant but ten days later they lost a doubleheader to Cleveland and fall out of the race. The Indians end the season with a record 111 wins, with the Yankees in second place. Mickey ended the season right at .300, with 102 rbi, 129 runs scored and 27 homers. His slow start and late season slump may have cost him the Triple Crown.",
