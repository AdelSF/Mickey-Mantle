        "question": "3. How did Mickey become a switch-hitter and such a great home run hitter?",
        "answer": "Mickey's dad, Mutt Mantle, was a great baseball fan. He shared his love of the game with Mickey. Every day after Mickey came home from school and Mutt returned from working in the lead mines, he and Mickey's grandfather Charlie would pitch to Mickey. Mickey batted left-handed against Mutt, who was right-handed, and right-handed against Grandpa Charlie, who was a lefty. From an early age Mickey showed tremendous natural talent and great power from both sides of the plate. It is said that Mutt foresaw the platooning that later became common in baseball, and that by teaching Mickey to switch-hit he insured that Mickey would play more in later years.",

        "question": "9. What was Mickey 's biggest contract with the Yankees?",
        "answer": "Mickey's largest contract with the Yankees was for $100,000. At the time he signed it in 1963 only Joe DiMaggio had received that much before. Mickey continued to play for that amount for the remainder of his career. Mickey, a very humble man, felt that it would be disrespectful of Joe DiMaggio for him to make more money than Joe. Naturally the Yankees were happy to oblige Mickey's stance.Of course, that was in the days when the \"reserve clause\" was included in every player's contract, thereby preventing players from moving to a different team without the consent of their current team. It had the effect of holding down salaries, preventing players from negotiating fair market value. Curt Flood was the first player to mount a legal challenge against the reserve clause, in 1969. The Supreme Court ruled to \"stand by things ruled\" (stare decisis) and left the reserve clause intact. His courageous stance brought baseball's anti-labor stance into the public eye. In 1975 pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally again challenged the reserve clause, this time in arbitration, and they were victorious. the way for other players to challenge it in the future. When asked what he thought he would make if he were playing now, Mickey said he liked what Joe DiMaggio said. Joe said that, if he were playing now, he would go up and knock on the door at Yankee Stadium. When Mr. Steinbrenner opened the door he would say, \"Howdy partner!\"",
